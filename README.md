Communication is the most important skill for improving our career. We all had haunted by the fear of public speaking at some point. Not only speaking on stage in front of hundreds of people, it could be school presentations, university viva / presentations and job interviews. Some people overcome this, but most of the people still didn’t have confidence in speaking. The only way to overcome this is, practicing by yourself. But there is a catch, you can’t practice by yourself because you need other one to give feedback about how you perform. If you have a good circle, then they can help you out. What if they are also like you? and everyone is not going to be there all time. Or, you can consult a therapist or coach and pay them to improve your ability. But, do you really need to pay couple of bucks to improve your skills ?? is this a video game? Mock- Buddy an AI assisted listener, is there for you to listen to all your talks and give feedback about it for free. Mock-Buddy’s vision is to empower everyone around the world to overcome the fear of public speaking and give a career boost.
